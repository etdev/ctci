### The problem
Create an algorithm to compress a string based on repeated character counts.
E.g. the string ``aabcccccaaa`` would become ``a2b1c5a3``.  Only compress a
string if it actually becomes smaller as a result.
### Initial algorithm attempt
```java
```

### Iteration #1
```java
```

### Final algorithm
```java
```

### Tests
```java
```
